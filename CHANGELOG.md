# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the repository
version is independent of the per-plugin versions, which are listed in each
release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Visual identity: mascot (`assets/logo.svg`), a mark per plugin
  (`plugins/<name>/assets/logo.svg`, referenced from the Cursor manifests), and
  a 1280×640 social preview.
- `SECURITY.md` with the hooks' behaviour contract and private reporting.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates (bug report, plugin proposal) and a PR
  template.
- This changelog.

### Changed
- README opens with what the agent actually sees (real nudges), a two-command
  quick start and a "What the hooks do — and don't" section, before the
  cognitive framing.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-15

First public release.

| Plugin | Version |
|--------|---------|
| executive-self-monitoring | 1.3.0 |
| epistemic-self-monitoring | 0.1.0 |
| persistence-self-monitoring | 0.1.0 |

### Added
- **executive-self-monitoring 1.3.0** — plan-anchored drift self-check,
  project-agnostic. Claude Code: `UserPromptSubmit` on turn 1 then every 5th;
  Cursor: `sessionStart` once per session; Agent Plugins manifest.
- **epistemic-self-monitoring 0.1.0** — observation-vs-conjecture discipline.
  Load / observe / close layers on both hosts; `[EPISTEMIC CLOSE]` closure
  gate, non-blocking by default, `EPIMON_STRICT=1` blocks once.
- **persistence-self-monitoring 0.1.0** — persist-or-quit signal from per-turn
  counters (same file edited 4×, same command or error failing 3×, 30 tool
  calls); never blocks.
- `scripts/test.js` (30 tests driving every hook adapter as its host would)
  and CI on Ubuntu/Windows × Node 18/20/22.
- `scripts/version.js` to keep each plugin's three manifests on one version.

### Fixed
- epistemic-self-monitoring: a mention of `[EPISTEMIC CLOSE]` in prose or
  backticks was scanned as a closure block; the marker must now stand alone
  on its line.
